brush your teeth twice a day 
tomorrow I will be narrating a story 
we should pray to god daily 
my father trust me 
Red fort is in Delhi 
Rohan is playing with the ball 
good manners win the love and respect of others 
the sleeper kept the rail safe 
the dog jumped into the pond 
Rishu is always late to school 
even strangers like a person who is respectful 
a soft answer saves us from many anger and a pitfall turns away 
good manners can be learnt best when one is young 
science has given man deadly weapons of warfare 
science has man with inventions which are not less than miracles armed 
brush your teeth twice a day
